The intent of this project is to showcase, implement and empirically analyse the ScaLE algorithm, a continuous time, particle based, Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling and performing interference on complex distributions in large N datasets. The `Scale2` package is developed and it's functionally explained, providing an implementation for `ScaLE` that is flexible & human-readable providing useful graphical methods for diagnosing convergence.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Scale2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ctrlbadger/Scale2")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(Scale2)
## basic example code
```
